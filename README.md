## üìã Overview

Velo Booster is an automated bot designed for farming XP and Battle Pass progression in Call of Duty: Warzone
The bot works by:

- Automatically queuing for Plunder matches
- Navigating game menus using computer vision
- Performing random movements in-game to avoid AFK detection
- Monitoring game state and automatically requeuing after matches end (currently supported only for Battle.net.)
- Providing Discord webhook notifications for game events
- Offering a user-friendly GUI interface

## ‚ú® Features

- **Fully Automated Operation**: Queue, play, and requeue without manual intervention
- **Computer Vision Technology**: Uses OpenCV to detect UI elements and game state
- **Discord Integration**: Real-time notifications about game status
- **Game Crash Recovery**: Watchdog feature that can restart the game if it crashes
- **Modern GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with game statistics

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Install Python 3.8+**
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Ensure you check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install pypiwin32 pillow opencv-python pyside6 requests
   ```

3. **Game Configuration**
   - Set Call of Duty: Modern Warfare/Warzone to **English language**
   - Configure the game to run in **Windowed mode**
   - Ensure the "Jump" button is bound to **SPACE**
   - If using the watchdog feature, set Battle.net launcher to English and keep it open
